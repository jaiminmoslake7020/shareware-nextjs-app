# Welcome to SSN Validator web app for Shareware!

Hi! I have build this app for tech challenge provided by ShareWare.

This app takes user input and it validates against suggested rules in document to provide user input SSN is valid or not.

This one is developed with TypeScript, and NextJs (React), TailwindCSS.

This one to showcase my skills with NextJs and React which I am really comfortable with and have 5+ years of experience.

I have also added Github action which builds and deploys app to Netlify on push to main branch.
